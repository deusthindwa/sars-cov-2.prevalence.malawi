# Estimating pneumococcal carriage dynamics in adults living with HIV in a mature infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program in Malawi, a modelling study

Background:
Adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (ALWHIV) taking antiretrovirals (ART) have higher pneumococcal carriage and disease than adults without HIV (HIV-). To assess factors influencing the high carriage prevalence and generate evidence base for evaluating future pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) strategies in ALWHIV, we estimated carriage acquisition and clearance rates in a high transmission and disease-burdened setting.

Methods:
We collected longitudinal nasopharyngeal swabs from age-and sex-matched HIV- adults, ALWHIV with ART experience of more than 1 year (ART>1y) or less than 3 months (ART<3m) from communities around Blantyre, Malawi. Samples were taken at baseline, and then weekly during the 16 visits over the study period. We employed classical culture microbiology to measure carriage and determined pneumococcal serotypes using latex agglutination. Trajectories of serotype colonisation were fitted to Markov models to capture the dynamics of carriage adjusting for vaccine-serotype status, age, sex, number of household children under 5 years-old (U5), social economic status (SES) and seasonality.

Results:
At baseline, 65 adults were enrolled in each HIV group, totalling 195 adults of whom 51.8% were females, 25.6% cohabited with >1 child U5, and 41.6% lived in low SES. Median age was 33y (interquartile range [IQR]: 25-37). Baseline pneumococcal carriage prevalence of non-PCV13 serotypes (NVT) (26.2%) was higher than PCV13 serotypes (VT) (5.1%). In a multivariate longitudinal analysis, pneumococcal carriage acquisition was higher in females than males (NVT [Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.53, 95%CI:1.17-2.01]; VT [1.96, 1.11-3.49]). It was also higher in low than high SES (NVT [1.38, 1.03-1.83]; VT [2.06, 1.13-3.77]), in adults living with 2+ than 1 child U5 (VT [1.78, 1.05-3.01]), and in ALWHIV on ART>1y than HIV- adults (NVT [1.43, 1.01-2.02]. Moreover, ALWHIV on ART>1y cleared pneumococci slower than HIV- adults ([0.65, 0.47-0.90]). Residual VT 19F and 3 were highly acquired although NVT remained dominant.

Conclusions:
The disproportionately high point prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in ALWHIV on ART>1y is likely due to impaired nasopharyngeal clearance resulting in prolonged carriage. Our findings provide baseline estimates for comparison after new PCV strategies in ALWHIV are implemented.
